## Mo√Øssala Measles Outbreak

This datasets (~ 5000 cases) simulates an outbreak of Measles across Souther Chad. It is made of a main linelist and a corresponding laboratory dataset. 
The linelist is built so that `vacc_status`, `age_group`, `muac_cat` are associated with a `dead` `outcome`. 

Look at the `.Rmd` document for some ideas of analysis that can be done.
